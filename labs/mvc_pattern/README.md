# MVC Pattern Examples

This repository demonstrates the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern with two implementations:

1. `simplemvc` - A basic implementation that can be compiled and executed using the command line.
2. `students_mvc` - A slightly advanced implementation that can be executed in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
3. `Spring Boot` - [Spring Boot Example](https://github.com/KashifKhn/easybid_java_spring)

## About MVC

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern is a design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It communicates with the database, performs data manipulations, and defines how data is accessed.
2. **View**: Handles the display and presentation logic. It interacts with the user and displays data retrieved by the controller.
3. **Controller**: Manages user input and updates the model or view accordingly. It acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.

### Benefits of MVC

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct role, making the codebase more manageable.
- **Scalability**: MVC allows developers to expand the application by focusing on specific components.
- **Reusability**: Components like models and views can often be reused across different parts of an application.
